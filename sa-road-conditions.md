# Road Conditions

Road Conditions are temperature and precipitation details at a specific location of a service area, as reported by supervisors/inspector users.

To see Road Condition details, tap on the marker on the map.

## Creating Road Conditions

To create a Road Condition:

* On the map, tap and hold on a location
* Choose 'Add New Road Condition'
* The ‘New Road Condition’ window with a form will appear

* Fill out the form with details, such as Road and Air temperature, as well as Precipitation Type and Quantity.
* Tap 'Create'

The Road Condition marker icon will appear on the map and will be visible to all users.

## Road Conditions menu

The Road Conditions screen is accessible through the main menu and displays a list of all reported conditions.

The list can be filtered and sorted by depot and timeframe. Entries can also be searched by reporter, route and address.


## Road Conditions expiration

All Road Conditions automatically expire within 1 hour from reporting, and the status of a condition will change from 'Active' to 'Expired'.

Expired Road Conditions disappear from the map, but are available in the Road Conditions menu until the end of a Storm Event.
