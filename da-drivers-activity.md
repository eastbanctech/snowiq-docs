# Driver's Activity

## Working on Assignments


### Accepting Assignment

When a Supervisor assigns a route, a ticket, or an address-specific assignment, the Driver will receive a notification as pictured below. Press 'Ok' and follow the steps below:

- Get directions to the location of the assignment by using the navigate button in the app (the blue arrow icon in the top right corner), which opens Google Maps to provide directions. 
- Once the system starts tracking that the Driver is working on the assignment, i.e. the Driver's GPS location is on the assigned route or address, the system will change the status of the Active Assignment to 'Started' in the status bar and begin displaying breadcrumbs to indicate the route that was worked on, as shown below. 
- Alternatively, the Driver can manually go to the Navigation drawer and press 'Start Assignment'.


### Assignments Menu

The driver app has an Assignments Menu, which contains a list of current, future and historical assignments.

This screen is accessible through the main menu.


### Completing Assignments

A Driver can complete their Active Assignment by opening the Navigation drawer and selecting 'Complete Assignment' as seen below.

This removes the assignment from the Status bar and also moves it from Active Assignments to the History tab in the 'Assignments' panel in the Operations Menu. If the Driver has another Assignment in the queue (in the 'Future' tab in the 'Assignments' panel), then the Driver will receive the notification as seen below and will follow the process as specified in the "Accepting Assignments"  section above.


### Completing Multi-Pass Assignment

If a Driver receives an Assignment with Multi-pass toggled on, it will be indicated in the notification. Once the Driver completes a pass, they will press 'Complete Pass' in the Navigation drawer and will await further instructions from the supervisor as specified in the status bar as seen below. 
  - If a Supervisor chooses another pass for this assignment, the Driver will receive the following notification to proceed work on the multi-pass assignment until it is completed, repeating the above steps for each pass.

  - If a Supervisor determines that no addditional passes are needed, the Assignment will be removed from the Driver's Active Assignments and will then be displayed in the 'History' tab on the 'Assignments' panel. The status bar will be updated to alert the driver to wait for any further instructions. 


### Pause/Resume Assignment

When a Supervisor pauses Assignment, the Driver receives the following notification:
