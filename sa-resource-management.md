# Resource Management

The Resource Management screen is accessible using the main menu of the Supervisor App.

The Resource Management screen displays list of existing resources within the current active event.

Resources can be filtered by Depot State, and Type.

To manage a resource, slide its list's row to the left and tap the option.

Tap on the switch at the top of the screen to access the Requests view.

The Requests view displays a list of drivers who have requested to participate in the current active event.

## Check-In Resources

To Check-in a Driver, slide its list's row to the left and tap Check-in.

When the Check-in Request modal opens, you can review details and confirm/deny a driver.

Once a Request is successfully confirmed, the driver is validated as a (New) resource.


## Shift Handover

When assignments need to be moved from one resource to another, a user can initiate a shift handover procedure.

Once the handover procedure is completed and assignments are moved to the new resource, the previous driver is automatically released from an assignment.


## Release Resources

When a Driver has finished his assignments, he can be released from duty.

Release of a driver will result in an automatic logout of the driver from the Driver App.

The Truck assigned to the driver that was released becomes available for assignment to another driver.
